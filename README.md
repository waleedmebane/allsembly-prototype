Allsemblyâ„¢ Prototype
====================

This software will be for creating an online community for anonymous proposal and collaborative evaluation of public policy options, with automated decision support.
It makes use of betting markets and probabilistic inference.
Some additional explanation may be found in the _Introduction_ section of the 
documentation, in misc/notes.md, and in misc/prospectus.pdf.

Only about half of the major features have been added, so far.

A demo server is currently deployed at https://waleedmebane.com/  <br />
The documentation is currently hosted at https://waleedmebane.github.io/allsembly-docs/ .
You may also generate the documentation from the files in the docs
subdirectory using the documentation creation tool, Sphinx
(https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

I do not expect to develop the prototype further until Fall or later.
