      the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.
   
      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
      license document.
   
      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during

          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
          a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
          system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
          of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
          Version."
